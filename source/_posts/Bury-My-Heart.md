> 收起地铺卧在床板睡觉一直不得安稳，半夜总觉有东西硌我腰。盛怒之下一把把床单揪起，褥穷笔记本现。竟是五年前我的日记本！忍住找了个没人的地儿小心翻阅，呀哒，这熊孩子当年稚嫩得可爱。

以下是日记摘录(其五)。<br>
### 二零一五年一月二十五日 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;星期日 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;晴
- - - 
I see the stars through across the blue sky
I remember the sky covered by the red<br>
All the sodiers were down
Their aches have been burnt
Nothing left but the quiet<br>
Only I still stand live among the corpses
Step the bodies who were ever all my mates
Pick up the pieces whose body has gone<br>
I survive in the war while winning the war
a meaningless war for the world<br>
I stand after the war just search for her
the lovely home once we ever had<br>
Then I dig a hole to bury all the corpses
to build a tomb for the world<br>
I bury all the corpses and bury the war with blood everywhere<br>
Just bury my heart<br>
I survive in the war while winning the war
a useless war for the world<br>
I stand after the war just search for my heart
put back it in my chest<br>
Then I just dig a hole with my last glance of the world 
where I used to love<br>
So I calmly face death kiss all my mates
without even the last breath<br>
Please bury my heart<br>
